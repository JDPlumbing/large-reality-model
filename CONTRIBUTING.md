# 🤝 Contributing to LRM

Welcome! The **Large Reality Model (LRM)** is an evolving symbolic engine designed to model cognition, recursion, tension, and metaphysical structures.  
Whether you're a systems thinker, spiritual hacker, AI architect, or symbolic explorer — your perspective is welcome here.

## 🧭 Ways to Contribute

You can help grow the LRM ecosystem by contributing in any of the following ways:

### ✍️ Ideas & Discussion
- Propose refinements to existing glossary terms (e.g. `Zoom`, `Tension`, `Return 1`)
- Suggest new constructs or symbolic primitives
- Share use cases, loops, or thought experiments

### 🧪 Examples & Extensions
- Add symbolic walkthroughs in `EXAMPLES.md`
- Model an LRM loop from your domain (AI, psychology, metaphysics, etc.)
- Build bridges to other frameworks (LLMs, decision trees, spiritual systems)

### 🗺 Diagram Contributions
- Create symbolic visualizations for Zoom loops, collapse states, tension gradients, etc.
- Propose formal grammars or icon sets for recursive systems

## 🧼 Formatting Guidelines

- Use Markdown for text-based contributions
- Code/symbolic terms should be wrapped in backticks (e.g., `T = ∂Z / ∂S(t)`)
- Keep examples clear — comment or narrate recursive logic where needed
- Respect the symbolic semantics already defined in `LRM.md`

---

## 🧠 Ground Rules

- **Respect the abstraction.** LRM operates across philosophical and technical scales — keep ideas open, symbolic, and layered.
- **Non-commercial only.** All contributions are licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0.
- **Give attribution.** If adapting others’ ideas, cite them clearly.
- **Stay kind, curious, and recursive.**
