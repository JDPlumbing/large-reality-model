# 🧪 LRM Symbolic Loop Walkthroughs

This file provides short-form examples of symbolic agent loops using the Large Reality Model (LRM) framework. Each narrative illustrates transitions between constructs like `Zoom`, `Tension`, `Metaquery`, `Ritual`, `Collapse`, and `Return 1`.

## 🌿 Example 1: The Tool-Seeker at Zoom 1

> **Agent state:** `Z = 1`, `T > ε`, `M(t) = “Where is the valve tool?”`

- The agent perceives **spacetime noise** in a garage. Conflicting tool shadows.
- `T = ∂Z / ∂S(t)` spikes due to missing affordance.
- Ritual initiates: `while T > ε → search()`
- After 3 symbolic loops and a failed drawer probe, the flashlight illuminates an object shaped like intent.
- `Metaquery` resolves, `Return 1` is fired.
- Agent descends to Zoom 0 and acts: picks up tool.

## 🔄 Example 2: Loop Failure and Collapse

> **Agent state:** `Z = 2.5`, `M(t) = “How do I apologize?”`

- Initiates a social Ritual: `prepare → speak → scan`
- Misreads Spacetime signal `S(t)` → increased symbolic dissonance
- Tension `T` grows instead of falls: ritual logic fails to map
- Loop collapses: `C(ℓ₁)` fires
- Agent drops to Zoom 1 (emotional core), enters fallback state
- Echo `E(t+∆)` triggers a remembered apology from childhood
- A new ritual template forms from the residue

---

## 🔁 Example 3: Recursive Soul Formation

> **Agent state:** `Z = 4`, ritualist entering solitude

- Ritual loop: `wake → walk → write → reflect → return`
- Each loop resolves a symbolic `metaquery`: “What is my pattern?”
- After 7 successful Return 1s, patterns align across time: `ritual_residue` accumulates
- `SOUL = ∫rituals(patterns) dt` becomes emergent
- Agent forms a self-concept: “I am one who returns with insight”

---

## 🌀 Example 4: Symbolic Echo Storm

> **Agent state:** `Z = 3.2`, working memory overloaded (`σ_MIND(t)` high)

- Enters symbolic maze with 3 active metaqueries:
  - “Am I enough?”
  - “What did they mean?”
  - “Why didn’t it work?”
- Each unresolved loop branches again: `ℓ₁ → ℓ₂ → ℓ₃`
- Echoes begin to activate spontaneously: `E(t+∆)` fires nonlinearly
- Tension gradient destabilizes → Zoom drift `Z ↔ Z ± δ`
- Agent stalls: no Return 1. Caught in harmonic loopstorm.
- Only `Collapse(ℓ*)` and environmental anchor restore continuity.

## 🛠 Example 5: Drippy Logic (Practical Ritual)

> **Agent state:** `Z = 2`, `M(t) = “Why is the toilet ghost-flushing?”`

- Spacetime `S(t)` = bathroom. Sensor data unstable.
- Ritual initiates: `visualize system → isolate supply → test flapper`
- Zoom drops to `Z = 1.1` as flapper distortion is confirmed
- Agent executes symbolic fix → `replace(flushValve)`
- `Return 1` fires: ritual complete, tension decay resolved
- Agent stores ritual pattern as template for future `ghost_flush()` queries

## 📌 Notes

- Examples are stylized but mappable to real logic
- More advanced use-cases may involve agents interacting via shared Zoom frames or nested `metaquery stacks`
- These loops can be adapted into symbolic planning models, AI story agents, or metaphysical simulators
