# Large Reality Model (LRM)

The **Large Reality Model** is a symbolic framework for modeling cognition, recursion, tension, and metaphysical closure. Born inside a plumbing diagnostic AI (Drippy), it evolved into a unifying architecture that bridges:

- ðŸ§  Cognitive systems  
- ðŸ”§ Tool-based reasoning  
- ðŸ“¿ Ritual logic and recursion  
- ðŸŒŒ Symbolic metaphysics

LRM is a reality-scale cognitive model â€” a recursive symbolic engine for agents navigating both physical and abstract space.

---

## âœ¨ What Is This?

LRM provides a system for modeling symbolic intelligence using constructs like:
- **Zoom levels** (abstraction frames)
- **Tension** between perception and environment
- **Ritual** as recursive resolution
- **Metaqueries** as internal questions
- **Return 1** as symbolic loop closure
- **Echo**, **Collapse**, **Mind**, and **Soul** as emergent symbolic states

---

## ðŸ›  Use Cases

- Design symbolic agents and decision systems
- Model spiritual, psychological, or ritual behavior
- Build abstractions atop physical simulations (like plumbing, robotics, or systems)
- Prototype recursive AI planning or story logic
- Explore metaphysical structure in a formal way

## ðŸ§  Origin

LRM began as a practical model for scaling abstraction in a plumbing diagnostic tool called **Drippy**. Through recursive tool modeling, it evolved into a generalized structure capable of capturing ritualized action, symbolic cognition, and conceptual emergence.
