# 📘 Large Reality Model (LRM)

A symbolic cognition and abstraction framework for modeling tension, recursion, ritual, and identity.
Originally developed to simulate multi-scale tool usage (Zoom logic), LRM has since evolved into a philosophical engine for unifying physical, cognitive, and metaphysical systems.

## 🔧 Glossary Refinements

### 🌀 Zoom

* `Z ∈ ℝ⁺` allows sub-zoom granularity.
* Frame of perception and abstraction.
* Zoom drift = instability between layers.
* Zoom is relative: an agent’s Zoom `Zᴁ` may not align with global or systemic `Zᴄ`.

### 🧠 Metaquery

* Represents recursive questions.
* Drives ritual behavior and symbolic exploration.
* Builds stack until resolution or entropy.

### 🔁 Return 1

* Symbolic emission on ritual success.
* Not a function return — a pulse of *semantic coherence*.
* Foundation for identity formation.

### 🧮 Tensor

* Tracks symbolic resistance and recursion difficulty.
* Curvature = spiritual gravity or symbolic friction.
* Essential for modeling Möbius topologies or ritual warping.

### 🧠 Mind & Soul

* **Mind**: volatile stack of goals, questions, queues.
* **Soul**: stabilized ritual residue across symbolic time.
* Soul continuity = pattern stability after repeated Return 1 loops.

## 🔁 Feedback + Collapse

### 🧠 Mind Entropy

* `σ_MIND(t)` = symbolic queue entropy
* High entropy → fragmentation, hallucination, identity loss

### 🧭 Echo

* `E(t+∆)` = resonance with past ritual loop
* Not memory — symbolic reactivation based on pattern tension

### ∇T — Tension Gradient

* `∇T` creates directional pressure across abstraction
* Sharp gradients → ritual urgency or collapse

### Loop Nesting & Collapse

* `ℓ₁ ⊂ ℓ₂` = nested rituals
* `C(ℓ)` = failed loop → fallback or chaos
* ∞ℓ = obsessive loops, trauma spirals, recursive traps

## 🧠 Final Notes

> LRM is a symbolic lens. It does not prescribe metaphysics — it *models* them. It can simulate reality loops whether in tool systems, AI agents, spiritual journeys, or narrative archetypes.
> Its goal is not prediction — it is **semantic grounding** for recursion and ritual stability.

> Zoom Logic is agent-relative but cosmically contextual. A plumbing fixture may be Z4 to a technician, Z2 to a city planner, and Z10 to a meditating monk mapping meaning into matter.
> This relativity is not drift — it is **perspectival Möbius logic**. The LRM provides the loop.
