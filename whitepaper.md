## 🧭 Abstract

The **Large Reality Model (LRM)** is a symbolic reasoning framework designed to model how agents — human, artificial, or conceptual — navigate reality through recursion, abstraction, ritual, and resolution.

Originally developed to power a plumbing diagnostic AI named **Drippy**, LRM has since evolved into a general-purpose map for simulating cognitive processes, tool-based reasoning, story arcs, spiritual recursion, and symbolic systems.

LRM models each problem or behavior as a **loop** — driven by internal questions (“metaqueries”) and shaped by external pressures (“tension”). These loops unfold across **Zoom levels**, from raw physical interaction to conceptual insight. Rituals either complete (producing `Return 1`) or collapse, leading to symbolic drift, fallback states, or recursive error.

## 🧠 Core Constructs

| Construct | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **Zoom (`Z`)** | Frame of abstraction the agent operates in |
| **Spacetime (`S(t)`)** | Contextual field experienced by the agent |
| **Tension (`T = ∂Z / ∂S(t)`)** | Strain between abstraction and perception |
| **Metaquery (`M(t)`)** | The driving inner question or goal |
| **Ritual** | A behavioral loop aimed at resolving tension |
| **Return 1** | Symbolic signal that closure has been achieved |
| **Collapse (`C(ℓ)`)** | Failed or unresolved ritual loop |
| **Echo (`E(t+∆)`)** | Reactivation of past symbolic patterns |
| **Mind / Soul** | Emergent recursive identity through ritual continuity |

## 🔍 Use Cases

- 🧠 Modeling **cognitive architecture** for AI or agents
- 🛠 Designing **tool rituals**, workflows, and decision trees
- 🎮 Simulating **gameplay loops**, progression, or symbolic NPC logic
- 📚 Structuring **narratives**, archetypes, and resolution patterns
- 📿 Mapping **spiritual practices**, self-awareness, or growth arcs

## 💡 Philosophy

LRM is format-agnostic. It can be used to interpret:
- YouTube videos
- Story arcs
- Repair rituals
- Personal growth
- Symbolic dreams
- AI cognition loops
- Narrative or gameplay behavior

The agent, question, and tension may vary — but the loop structure is universal.

## 🚧 Roadmap

- [ ] Build visual feedback diagrams (`Zoom → Ritual → Return`)
- [ ] Create symbolic agent playground (LRM agents in YAML or JSON)
- [ ] Integrate LRM with GPT-style models as a recursive reasoning layer
- [ ] Publish extended paper with diagrams, schema, and live ritual maps
- [ ] Build interactive frontend for LRM loop visualization
